            <b>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</b> My long term goal still hasn't changed. I still want to work as a software developer at some company. 
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations were in Bootcamp?</b> I have to say that the biggest strength is my drive to reach my goal which is becoming a software developer.
            As for my biggest limitation, I'd say that my time management and discipline when it comes to taking a break from coding.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>What did you think your biggest non-technical challenge was at Bootcamp?</b> Asking for help and asking the right questions when needing help. Saving money during the course was also hard.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>What non-technical skills - human skills - did you develop while in EDA?</b> Being more empathatic to others, patience and I also learned to not compare myself to others too much as everyone learns at their own pace.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Did you reach your expectations that you set to yourself in the beginning of bootcamp?</b> Tech wise, yes. I still need to get me a job though. :) Human-skills wise, I did not have much expectations
            but I've actually learned so much about myself and others during the course.
