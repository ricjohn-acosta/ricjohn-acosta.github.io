            Neuroplasticity is the ability of the brain to change continuously. Understanding the principles of neuroplasticity can be useful when it comes to learning as neuroplasticity
            benifits people a lot when it comes to learning. We know that the brain can change continuously, with this we can use this principle and apply it when it comes to learn better
            and behave differently. One thing that I know works the most when trying to increase neuroplasticity would be constant practice. I heavily embrace the fact that repeating 
            an activity or practicing helps a lot when it comes to memory retrieval. The more we practice, the easier a task gets.

            Growth mindset is very relevant because it allows people to get out of their comfort zones and learn that there are more to themselves than what they currently have.
            I've always known this concept and I think it is the best way for someone to grow physically and mentally. I believe that having an open mind when it comes to learning is the best
            trait an academic person could have and is something I am personally working on each day.
