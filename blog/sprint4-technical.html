        <p class="blog-content">
            Throughout my programming career I've encountered quite a bit of problems and most of the time I do get stuck. The most recent memory about getting stuck that I can recall
            is when I was doing my first data structures assignment. When I saw the project brief everything felt so foreign to me and I thought that there is no way I would be able
            to complete this assignment. However, I did not let this fear take over me and I started simple by trying to understand what I need to do and from there I slowly wrote
            empty functions that I needed. After writing a structure, I was surprised at how simple it actually was when I was figuring out the logic. Everything came together well 
            but I was still getting stuck at some parts. If I get really stuck I ask for help from my peers and my lecturers and everything went fine. I learned that it's okay to ask
            for help and it's definitely okay to google problems you're stuck at.

            <br>
            While I was doing the katas, I've noticed that I've used quite a bit of problem solving techniques and processes, mainly Pseudocode, console logging and googling. Usually,
            after I've done these three things I tend to have solved the problem already. When I get to the point where I feel helpless and frustrated and I cannot concentrate at all,
            that's when I go to my peers and mentors for help.
