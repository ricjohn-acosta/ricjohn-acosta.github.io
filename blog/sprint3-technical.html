            I consider HTML and CSS the building blocks of modern websites. These two has been around for quite a while now and without HTML or CSS we wouldn't have websites today.
            Both HTML and CSS are used in tandem when making a website. To put it simply, HTML is the "meat" of the website while CSS would be the "seasoning". HTML handles the
            content in a website such as images/text while the purpose of CSS is to make these images/texts look pretty and be placed where they should be placed.

            Meanwhile, Javascript is on whole new level compared to these two "languages". Javascript is an actual high-level programming language that does much more compared to
            HTML and CSS. Using Javascript alongside HTML and CSS brings more into the table when it comes to web development. Javascript can add interactive behaviour to web pages,
            handle databases and much more. Since Javascript is an actual programming language, a typical software written in Javascript will have control flows and loops.
            Control flows are sequences of actions executed consecutively while loops are basically, well, loops. Loops are useful if we need to do something MANY times. (E.g 
            iterating through a database). Javascript also brings in arrays, objects and functions which are very useful when building software. Basically, arrays and objects
            both store data and this data can be accessed. For arrays, data can be accessed by using a simple syntax e.g: console.log(array[0]). For objects, we can do access data
            in two ways, 1.) console.log(object["property"]) 2.) console.log(object.property). Lastly, functions are reusable blocks of code that contains logic for a particular
            task that needs to be done multiple times (better way instead of copy and pasting code!).

            Let's talk about the HTML Document Object Model (DOM) since every website is under this concept. The HTML DOM is basically a way for us programmers to access HTML
            elements easily. The best way to interact with the DOM would be to open up google chrome, right click in ANY website and click inspect. By doing this, you are pretty much
            fiddling around with HTML elements.
