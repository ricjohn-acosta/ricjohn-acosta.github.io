            <b>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</b> I learned that I am patient, ask a lot of questions and I take my time when stuck with a problem.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</b> To me, when it comes to learning and programming. We always need to be self-aware that it is okay to get stuck at something and it is normal to feel frustrated when it comes to programming. When teaching someone, empathy has a really big role because one needs to understand that everyone has their own style of learning.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</b> The advantages learning how to learn gives you.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</b> Telling myself to do the core exercises even though I don't feel like it.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</b> Traditional schools does not teach you how to be a good person and how to prime yourself to learn programming.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.</b> Not really but definitely more emphasis on programming.
