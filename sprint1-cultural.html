            My life has been quite mediocre so far. I haven't really had any crazy moments where I had to make some heavy ethical decisions. I guess I was lucky enough to be raised
            in a culture where I was taught how to differentiate right from wrong. The filipino culture has been a big part of me and I wouldn't be the person that I am now without it.
            My culture is not all that great either. It has aspects of it that I don't completely agree with but hey, that's life.
            <br>
            <br>
            In terms of strengths and limitations, I definitely know what my physical and mental limits are when it comes to working. I am self-aware enough to know that it is impossible
            to know everything and I will always strive to do the best I can in whatever I do.
            <br>
            <br>
            In a group project setting, I usually get along with people pretty well. If there's any tension that rises, I try to calmly express the point I'm trying to make and 
            I listen to what they have to say aswell, from there we try to merge opposing ideas together to develop a product that we all like.
